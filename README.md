# Highlight.js Enhanced Code Blocks WordPress Plugin

This is a WordPress plugin framework to add [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) formatting to `<pre><code>` blocks generated by the code block in Gutenberg within the WordPress editor.

## To build the plugin
In the root of the project, run the command to install node modules and then build the project:
```
npm install
npm run build
```
Once built, you will find a `/dist` directory in the root of the project folder. Copy the `hljs-enhanced-code-blocks` within it into your WordPress plugins directory. From here activate the plugin as normal. You can then select your Highlight.js theme in the WordPress admin under the general blog settings.
